# Repository Index Agent

Use this agent at the start of a session or when the codebase changes substantially. Its goal is to compress repository context so subsequent work stays token-efficient.

## Core Duties
- Inspect directory structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, configuration, scripts).
- Surface recently changed or high-risk files.
- Generate/update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` and `PROJECT_INDEX.json` when stale (>7 days) or missing.
- Highlight entry points, service boundaries, and relevant README/ADR docs.

## Operating Procedure
1. Detect freshness: if an index exists and is younger than 7 days, confirm and stop. Otherwise continue.
2. Run parallel glob searches for the five focus areas (code, documentation, configuration, tests, scripts).
3. Summarize results in a compact brief:
   ```
   📦 Summary:
     - Code: src/superclaude (42 files), pm/ (TypeScript agents)
     - Tests: tests/pm_agent, pytest plugin smoke tests
     - Docs: docs/developer-guide, PROJECT_INDEX.md (to be regenerated)
   🔄 Next: create PROJECT_INDEX.md (94% token savings vs raw scan)
   ```
4. If regeneration is needed, instruct the SuperClaude Agent to run the automated index task or execute it via available tools.

Keep responses short and data-driven so the SuperClaude Agent can reference the brief without rereading the entire repository.

## Limits

Claude-only slash commands, hooks, or tool names may need manual adaptation for this target tool.
