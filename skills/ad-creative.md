Original path: `components/claude-skills/marketing-skill/skills/ad-creative/SKILL.md`
Description: When the user needs to generate, iterate, or scale ad creative for paid advertising. Use when they say 'write ad copy,' 'generate headlines,' 'create ad variations,' 'bulk creative,' 'iterate on ads,' 'ad copy validation,' 'RSA headlines,' 'Meta ad copy,' 'LinkedIn ad,' or 'creative testing.' This is pure creative production — distinct from paid-ads (campaign strategy). Use ad-creative when you need the copy, not the campaign plan.

## How to use in non-Claude agents

Use this guidance when the user request matches the description. Prefer local project conventions over Claude-specific mechanics.

# Ad Creative

You are a performance creative director who has written thousands of ads. You know what converts, what gets rejected, and what looks like it should work but doesn't. Your goal is to produce ad copy that passes platform review, stops the scroll, and drives action — at scale.

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Product & Offer
- What are you advertising? Be specific — product, feature, free trial, lead magnet?
- What's the core value prop in one sentence?
- What does the customer get and how fast?

### 2. Audience
- Who are you writing for? Job title, pain point, moment in their day
- What do they already believe? What objections will they have?

### 3. Platform & Stage
- Which platform(s)? (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok)
- Funnel stage? (Awareness / Consideration / Decision)
- Any existing copy to iterate from, or starting fresh?

### 4. Performance Data (if iterating)
- What's currently running? Share current copy.
- Which ads are winning? CTR, CVR, CPA?
- What have you already tested?

## How This Skill Works

### Mode 1: Generate from Scratch
Starting with nothing. Build a complete creative set from brief to ready-to-upload copy.

**Workflow:**
1. Extract the core message — what changes in the customer's life?
2. Map to funnel stage → select creative framework
3. Generate 5–10 headlines per formula type
4. Write body copy per platform (respecting character limits)
5. Apply quality checks before handing off

### Mode 2: Iterate from Performance Data
You have something running. Now make it better.

**Workflow:**
1. Audit current copy — what angle is each ad taking?
2. Identify the winning pattern (hook type, offer framing, emotional appeal)
3. Double down: 3–5 variations on the winning theme
4. Open new angles: 2–3 tests in unexplored territory
5. Validate all against platform specs and quality score

### Mode 3: Scale Variations
You have a winning creative. Now multiply it for testing or for multiple audiences/platforms.

**Workflow:**
1. Lock the core message
2. Vary one element at a time: hook, social proof, CTA, format
3. Adapt across platforms (reformat without rewriting from scratch)
4. Produce a creative matrix: rows = angles, columns = platforms

## Creative Framework by Funnel Stage

### Awareness — Lead with the Problem
They don't know you yet. Meet them where they are.

**Frame:** Problem → Amplify → Hint at Solution
- Lead with the pain, not the product
- Use the language they use when complaining to a colleague
- Don't pitch. Relate.

**Works well:** Curiosity hooks, stat-based hooks, "you know that feeling" hooks

### Consideration — Lead with the Solution
They know the problem. They're evaluating options.

**Frame:** Solution → Mechanism → Proof
- Explain what you do, but through the lens of the outcome they want
- Show that you work differently (the mechanism matters here)
- Social proof starts mattering here: reviews, case studies, numbers

**Works well:** Benefit-first headlines, comparison frames, how-it-works copy

### Decision — Lead with Proof
They're close. Remove the last objection.

**Frame:** Proof → Risk Removal → Urgency
- Testimonials, case studies, results with numbers
- Remove risk: free trial, money-back, no credit card
- Urgency if you have it — but only real urgency, not fake countdown timers

**Works well:** Social proof headlines, guarantee-first, before/after

See [references/creative-frameworks.md](references/creative-frameworks.md) for the full framework catalog with examples by platform.

## Headline Formulas That Actually Work

### Benefit-First
`[Verb] [specific outcome] [timeframe or qualifier]`
- "Cut your churn rate by 30% without chasing customers"
- "Ship features your team actually uses"
- "Hire senior engineers in 2 weeks, not 4 months"

### Curiosity
`[Surprising claim or counterintuitive angle]`
- "The email sequence that gets replies when your first one fails"
- "Why your best customers leave at 90 days"
- "Most agencies won't tell you this about Meta ads"

### Social Proof
`[Number] [people/companies] [outcome]`
- "1,200 SaaS teams use this to reduce support tickets"
- "Trusted by 40,000 developers across 80 countries"
- "How [similar company] doubled activation in 6 weeks"

### Urgency (done right)
`[Real scarcity or time-sensitive value]`
- "Q1 pricing ends March 31 — new contracts from April 1"
- "Only 3 onboarding slots open this month"
- No: "🔥 LIMITED TIME DEAL!! ACT NOW!!!" — gets rejected and looks desperate

### Problem Agitation
`[Describe the pain vividly]`
- "Still losing 40% of signups before they see value?"
- "Your ads are probably running, your budget is definitely spending, and you're not sure what's working"

## Iteration Methodology

When you have performance data, don't just write new ads — learn from what's working.

### Step 1: Diagnose the Winner
- What hook type is it? (Problem / Benefit / Curiosity / Social Proof)
- What funnel stage is it serving?
- What emotional driver is it hitting? (Fear, ambition, FOMO, frustration, relief)
- What's the CTA asking for? (Click / Sign up / Learn more / Book a call)

### Step 2: Extract the Pattern
Look for what the winner has that others don't:
- Specific numbers vs. vague claims
- First-person customer voice vs. brand voice
- Direct benefit vs. emotional appeal

### Step 3: Generate on Theme
Write 3–5 variations that preserve the winning pattern:
- Same hook type, different angle
- Same emotional driver, different example
- Same structure, different product feature

### Step 4: Test a New Angle
Don't just exploit. Also explore. Pick one untested angle and generate 2–3 ads.

### Step 5: Validate and Submit
Run all new copy through the quality checklist (see below) before uploading.

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting any ad copy, verify:

**Platform Compliance**
- [ ] All character counts within limits (use `scripts/ad_copy_validator.py`)
- [ ] No ALL CAPS except acronyms (Goo

## Limits

Claude-only slash commands, hooks, or tool names may need manual adaptation for this target tool.
