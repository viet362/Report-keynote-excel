Original path: `components/claude-skills/productivity/email/skills/inbox-setup/SKILL.md`
Description: One-time setup skill that builds a personalized inbox triage knowledge base via interactive interview. Interviews the user about their email patterns, business context, reply style, and priorities using grill-me discipline (one question at a time, forcing format where possible, dependency-ordered, each question explains why I'm asking), then generates the knowledge base files that power the companion 'inbox-triage' skill. Run this once before using inbox-triage for the first time. Re-run when business, pricing, or priorities change significantly. Triggers: 'set up my inbox', 'configure inbox triage', 'set up my email system', 'configure email triage', 'build my email knowledge base', 'initialize email management', 'set up inbox triage', 'onboard email triage', or any variation where someone wants to get the email triage system running for the first time.

# Inbox-Setup — Email Triage Onboarding

> **Paired with `inbox-triage`.** This skill writes the 7-file knowledge base at `${WORKSPACE}/Email/` that `inbox-triage` reads on every run. The file contracts (names, sections, fields) MUST match between the two skills exactly. See [`references/kb_file_contract.md`](references/kb_file_contract.md).

Run once (or re-run when business/priorities change). Interview the user about their email patterns, business context, reply style, and priorities. Generate the structured knowledge base in `${WORKSPACE}/Email/` that captures everything `inbox-triage` needs to process the inbox effectively.

## Invocation Triggers

- "set up my inbox"
- "configure inbox triage"
- "set up my email system"
- "configure email triage"
- "build my email knowledge base"
- "initialize email management"
- "set up inbox triage"
- "onboard email triage"

## Conduct Discipline

**Do NOT generate all files at once.** Walk through the 8 sections one at a time. Each section commits its file(s) before moving on. Partial completion (e.g., user drops off mid-interview) still produces a usable partial KB.

Grill-me discipline applies throughout:

- **One question per turn.** Never bundle. Even across section boundaries.
- **"Why I'm asking" on every question** — so users can answer well.
- **Forcing format where possible.** Multi-choice > open-ended.
- **Dependency-ordered.** Q2 depends on Q1; downstream sections depend on upstream.

See [`references/grill_me_section_walk.md`](references/grill_me_section_walk.md) for the 8-section discipline detail.

## Knowledge Base Contract — Files To Produce

Exactly these files at `${WORKSPACE}/Email/`:

| File | Purpose | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `email-taxonomy.md` | Classification system + report preferences | **Yes** |
| `email-patterns.md` | Reply voice, tone, templates, hard rules | **Yes** |
| `evaluation-framework.md` | Decision tree for opportunity emails | Only if user receives pitches/opportunities |
| `rate-card.md` | Pricing, terms, negotiation posture | Only if user has pricing |
| `blocklist.md` | Auto-skip senders + learned decline patterns | **Yes** (seeded, grows over time) |
| `tracker.md` | Active follow-ups, overdue items, deadlines | **Yes** (starts mostly empty) |
| `triage-log/` | Directory for per-run logs | **Yes** (created empty) |

The contract is identical to what `inbox-triage` expects — see [`references/kb_file_contract.md`](references/kb_file_contract.md) for the full spec.

## Stop Condition (Full Interview)

~25–31 questions total across the 8 sections (depending on skip-logic). Hard ceiling: 35 questions including all sub-clarifications. Section 4 (Evaluation Framework) is skipped entirely when Section 1 surfaced no opportunity-email category, dropping the total by 6 questions and the rate-card file. After Section 8's confirmation + handoff message, intake is closed — **never re-open it**. To change preferences later, the user re-runs the skill (which detects existing files and asks per-file: replace / merge / skip). The grill-me one-at-a-time rule applies across section boundaries: do NOT batch questions even when moving from S{n} to S{n+1}.

## Section 1: The Big Picture

Six grill-me questions, one at a time:

- **S1.Q1:** "What do you do? Give me your role and business in 1–2 sentences. *Why I'm asking:* Context shapes what email patterns to expect — a solo creator's inbox looks nothing like an enterprise PM's."
- **S1.Q2:** "What dominates your inbox? Pick the top 1–2: sales pitches / client work / internal team / newsletters / customer support / financial / other. *Why I'm asking:* Dominant categories drive the taxonomy."
- **S1.Q3:** "Rough volume split — e.g., '60% business inquiries, 20% ops, 20% noise'. *Why I'm asking:* The split tells me where to focus triage effort."
- **S1.Q4:** "Which email address(es) should triage cover? *Why I'm asking:* If multiple, I'll set up per-address taxonomies."
- **S1.Q5:** "Run frequency: once daily / 2x daily / 3x daily / on-demand only? *Why I'm asking:* Drives the default search window in triage (9h overlap for 2x/day)."
- **S1.Q6:** "Anyone helping manage email — assistant, VA, team — or solo? *Why I'm asking:* Persona handling differs for delegated inboxes."

**Action:** Build mental model. Do NOT write files yet. Note whether opportunity emails are a category (drives S4 skip-logic).

## Section 2: Email Categories

Propose 5–7 categories based on Section 1 — pre-recommend a subset, not the whole template menu:

- New Opportunities
- Active Conversations
- Action Required
- Financial
- Important/Personal
- Informational
- Ignore/Low Priority

Then three forcing questions, one at a time:

- **S2.Q1:** "Here's my proposed taxonomy: [list]. Does this match your inbox reality — yes / mostly / no? *Why I'm asking:* If 'no', I need to redo the taxonomy before any other section makes sense."
- **S2.Q2:** "Missing categories? List them. (Skip if none.) *Why I'm asking:* Missing categories produce uncategorized emails downstream, which hurts triage quality."
- **S2.Q3:** "Which category takes the MOST time per email? *Why I'm asking:* That's where draft-reply effort needs to focus most."

**Action:** Generate `email-taxonomy.md` with categories, signals (for each: trigger phrases / sender patterns / subject markers), and default actions per category.

## Section 3: Reply Style & Voice

Six grill-me questions plus the critical sample request:

- **S3.Q1:** "Register: formal / casual / in-between? *Why I'm asking:* Calibrates default voice; we'll refine from samples next."
- **S3.Q2:** "Three communication pet peeves — phrases you hate, openings you avoid. *Why I'm asking:* I treat these as forbidden tokens in drafts."
- **S3.Q3:** "Phrases or sign-offs you always use — list as many as come to mind. *Why I'm asking:* These are your voice fingerprints."
- **S3.Q4:** "Different persona for different contexts — e.g., assistant replies as you? *Why I'm asking:* Persona context changes pronoun + signature handling."
- **S3.Q5:** "Typical reply length — one-liner / short paragraph / longer? *Why I'm asking:* Length is the easiest voice signal to get wrong."
- **S3.Q6:** "Hard rules — never X / always Y? (E.g., never emojis, always reply within 24h, never take calls without context.) *Why I'm asking:* Hard rules are enforced as non-negotiable in every draft."

### S3.SAMPLES (the critical highest-quality input)

> **Paste 3–5 real sent emails from your inbox.**
>
> *Why I'm asking:* Self-description of voice is unreliable. Real samples are the best signal — I'll analyze them for voice patterns that supplement everything above. Use `scripts/voice_sample_analyzer.py` to extract patterns deterministically.

If user runs a business: also ask about media kits, rate sheets, standard pitches, repeated replies.

**Action:** Generate `email-patterns.md` with tone description (with do/don't examples), persona rules, templates, signatures, hard rules. See [`references
