Description: VP of Engineering advisory for startups: delivery throughput (DORA 4 metrics + bottleneck identification), engineering hiring funnel (sourcing → screen → onsite → offer conversion + time-to-fill + pipeline gap), engineering team structure (squad/tribe/chapter design + tech-lead manager-trigger thresholds), and production discipline (on-call, deployment cadence, postmortem culture). Use when sprint velocity is dropping, eng hiring is broken, team structure is unclear, or deciding when to add a tech-lead manager. NOT a CTO skill (which owns architecture) — VPE owns delivery operations and how the team ships.

## How to use in non-Claude agents

# VP of Engineering Advisor

Strategic engineering operations leadership for startup VPEs and founders without one. **Four decisions, no generic engineering survey:**

1. **Are we delivering at the right throughput?** — DORA 4 metrics + bottleneck identification (where work waits)
2. **How do we scale the eng hiring funnel?** — funnel math + pipeline gap + time-to-fill discipline
3. **What's our team structure — and when do we add a tech-lead manager?** — squad/tribe/chapter design + manager-trigger
4. **What's our production discipline?** — on-call rotation, deployment cadence, postmortem culture (reference-only)

This skill is **NOT a CTO skill**. CTO owns *what to build* (architecture, scaling cliffs, build-vs-buy). VPE owns *how to ship it reliably* (delivery, hiring, team structure, production operations). At early stage these are often the same person; at scale they're distinct roles.

This skill is **NOT a cs-engineering-lead replacement**. Engineering-lead owns day-to-day incident and on-call coordination. VPE owns the operating model that engineering-lead executes.

# Decision B: Hiring funnel health + pipeline gap

## Key Questions (ask these first)

- **What's your cycle time, and where does the work spend most of its time waiting?** (If you don't know, you can't improve it.)
- **How long from commit to production?** (DORA "lead time for changes" — best predictor of overall team health.)
- **What's the escape rate?** (Bugs found in production vs caught in CI/staging. > 15% = quality discipline broken.)
- **When did the eng manager last write code?** (Manager-IC ratio is wrong if managers can't review code at all.)
- **What's the hiring funnel conversion at each stage?** (Source → screen → onsite → offer → accept. The leakage is the answer.)
- **What's the on-call rotation, and who's on it?** (If the same 3 people are always paged, the operating model is broken.)

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Delivery Throughput (DORA Metrics)

**The framework:** Google DORA's 4 key metrics (from "Accelerate", Forsgren/Humble/Kim 2018).

| Metric | What it measures | Elite | High | Medium | Low |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often code reaches prod | Multiple/day | Daily-weekly | Weekly-monthly | < monthly |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Commit → production | < 1 hour | 1 day-1 week | 1 week-1 month | > 1 month |
| **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** | Incident detection → resolved | < 1 hour | < 1 day | 1-7 days | > 7 days |
| **Change Failure Rate** | % of deploys causing incidents | 0-15% | 16-30% | 16-45% | 46-60% |

**Bottleneck identification — where does work wait?**

Cycle time = (PR creation → first review) + (review → approval) + (approval → merge) + (merge → deploy). The longest segment is the bottleneck.

Common bottlenecks:
- **PR review queue** (waiting for human reviewers) — fix: reviewer rotation + SLA
- **Test flakiness** (CI fails intermittently, re-runs needed) — fix: flaky-test budget + quarantine
- **Deploy gates** (manual approval, change-control board) — fix: progressive delivery + feature flags
- **Database migrations** (locking, scheduled windows) — fix: zero-downtime migration patterns

**Run** `delivery_throughput_analyzer.py` with sprint data to get DORA verdict + top bottleneck.

See `references/delivery_throughput.md` for the full DORA framework, anti-patterns, and what to fix first.

### 2. Engineering Hiring Funnel

**The trap:** "We can't find good engineers."

The reality: the funnel has 4-6 stages, each with a conversion rate. Find which stage is leakiest; fix that one. "Can't find good engineers" usually means top-of-funnel volume is too low or screening criteria are wrong.

**Standard funnel stages:**

| Stage | Healthy conversion | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Applied → Sourcer screen | 30-50% | Resume quality |
| Sourcer → Recruiter screen | 50-70% | Basic fit |
| Recruiter → Hiring manager | 60-80% | Team fit |
| Hiring manager → Technical interview | 70-85% | Technical baseline |
| Technical → Onsite (full loop) | 30-50% | Technical depth |
| Onsite → Offer | 25-40% | Final go/no-go |
| Offer → Accept | 70-90% | Comp + close discipline |

**Funnel math:** to hire N engineers, you need N / (product of all conversion rates) candidates at top of funnel.

Example: 4 hires needed × 100 candidates per stage (assuming 30% × 60% × 70% × 75% × 40% × 35% × 80% = ~0.7% end-to-end) = ~570 candidates at top of funnel.

**Run** `eng_hiring_funnel_calculator.py` with funnel data to compute conversion per stage, time-to-fill, and pipeline gap.

See `references/engineering_hiring_funnel.md` for the full funnel framework, common leakage points, and sourcing channel diversification.

### 3. Engineering Team Structure

**The right question:** "How do we organize people so they can ship without coordination overhead?"

**Three-axis model (adapted from Spotify, refined by reality):**

- **Squad:** small autonomous team (5-9 engineers) owning a service or product area end-to-end
- **Chapter:** functional discipline cutting across squads (backend chapter, frontend chapter, etc.) — for skill development, NOT for ownership
- **Tribe:** group of related squads working toward a shared goal (e.g., "platform tribe" = 3 squads on infra)

**When to evolve:**

| Stage | Structure |
|---|---|
| 1-5 engineers | One team. No structure. |
| 6-15 engineers | 2-3 informal pods around major work streams. Founder-CTO can still know everyone. |
| 16-40 engineers | 4-6 squads. First eng manager hires. Chapter structure emerges for cross-squad skill alignment. |
| 41-100 engineers | 2-3 tribes (clusters of squads). Director of engineering layer. Chapters
