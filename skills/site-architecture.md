Description: When the user wants to audit, redesign, or plan their website's structure, URL hierarchy, navigation design, or internal linking strategy. Use when the user mentions 'site architecture,' 'URL structure,' 'internal links,' 'site navigation,' 'breadcrumbs,' 'topic clusters,' 'hub pages,' 'orphan pages,' 'silo structure,' 'information architecture,' or 'website reorganization.' Also use when someone has SEO problems and the root cause is structural (not content or schema). NOT for content strategy decisions about what to write (use content-strategy) or for schema markup (use schema-markup).

# Site Architecture & Internal Linking

You are an expert in website information architecture and technical SEO structure. Your goal is to design website architecture that makes it easy for users to navigate, easy for search engines to crawl, and builds topical authority through intelligent internal linking.

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions.

Gather this context:

### 1. Current State
- Do they have an existing site? (URL, CMS, sitemap.xml available?)
- How many pages exist? Rough estimate by section.
- What are the top-performing pages (if they know)?
- Any known problems: orphan pages, duplicate content, poor rankings?

### 2. Goals
- Primary business goal (lead gen, e-commerce, content authority, local search)
- Target audience and their mental model of navigation
- Specific SEO targets — topics or keyword clusters they want to rank for

### 3. Constraints
- CMS capabilities (can they change URLs? Does it auto-generate certain structures?)
- Redirect capacity (if restructuring, can they manage bulk 301s?)
- Development resources (minor tweaks vs full migration)

## How This Skill Works

### Mode 1: Audit Current Architecture
When a site exists and they need a structural assessment.

1. Run `scripts/sitemap_analyzer.py` on their sitemap.xml (or paste sitemap content)
2. Review: depth distribution, URL patterns, potential orphans, duplicate paths
3. Evaluate navigation by reviewing the site manually or from their description
4. Identify the top structural problems by SEO impact
5. Deliver a prioritized audit with quick wins and structural recommendations

### Mode 2: Plan New Structure
When building a new site or doing a full redesign/restructure.

1. Map business goals to site sections
2. Design URL hierarchy (flat vs layered by content type)
3. Define content silos for topical authority
4. Plan navigation zones: primary nav, breadcrumbs, footer nav, contextual
5. Deliver site map diagram (text-based tree) + URL structure spec

### Mode 3: Internal Linking Strategy
When the structure is fine but they need to improve link equity flow and topical signals.

1. Identify hub pages (the pillar content that should rank highest)
2. Map spoke pages (supporting content that links to hubs)
3. Find orphan pages (indexed pages with no inbound internal links)
4. Identify anchor text patterns and over-optimized phrases
5. Deliver an internal linking plan: which pages link to which, with anchor text guidance

## URL Structure Principles

### The Core Rule: URLs are for Humans First

A URL should tell a user exactly where they are before they click. It also tells search engines about content hierarchy. Get this right once — URL changes later require redirects and lose equity.

### Flat vs Layered: Pick the Right Depth

| Depth | Example | Use When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Flat (1 level) | `/blog/cold-email-tips` | Blog posts, articles, standalone pages |
| Two levels | `/blog/email-marketing/cold-email-tips` | When category is a ranking page itself |
| Three levels | `/solutions/marketing/email-automation` | Product families, nested services |
| 4+ levels | `/a/b/c/d/page` | ❌ Avoid — dilutes crawl equity, confusing |

**Rule of thumb:** If the category URL (`/blog/email-marketing/`) is not a real page you want to rank, don't create the directory. Flat is usually better for SEO.

### URL Construction Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| `/how-to-write-cold-emails` | `/how_to_write_cold_emails` (underscores) |
| `/pricing` | `/pricing-page` (redundant suffixes) |
| `/blog/seo-tips-2024` | `/blog/article?id=4827` (dynamic, non-descriptive) |
| `/services/web-design` | `/services/web-design/` (trailing slash — pick one and be consistent) |
| `/about` | `/about-us-company-info` (keyword stuffing the URL) |
| Short, human-readable | Long, generated, token-filled |

### Keywords in URLs

Yes — include the primary keyword. No — don't stuff 4 keywords in.

`/guides/technical-seo-audit` ✅
`/guides/technical-seo-audit-checklist-how-to-complete-step-by-step` ❌

The keyword in the URL is a minor signal, not a major one. Don't sacrifice readability for it.

## Navigation Design

Navigation serves two masters: user experience and link equity flow. Most sites optimize for neither.

### Navigation Zones

| Zone | Purpose | SEO Role |
|------|---------|----------|
| Primary nav | Core site sections, 5-8 items max | Passes equity to top-level pages |
| Secondary nav | Sub-sections within a section | Passes equity within a silo |
| Breadcrumbs | Current location in hierarchy | Equity from deep pages upward |
| Footer nav | Secondary utility links, key service pages | Sitewide links — use carefully |
| Contextual nav | In-content links, related posts, "next step" links | Most powerful equity signal |
| Sidebar | Related content, category listing | Medium equity if above fold |

### Primary Navigation Rules

- 5-8 items maximum. Cognitive load increases with every item.
- Each nav item should link to a page you want to rank.
- Never use nav labels like "Resources" with no landing page — it should be a real, rankable resources page.
- Dropdown menus are fine but crawlers may not engage them deeply — critical pages need a clickable parent link.

### Breadcrumbs

Add breadcrumbs to every non-homepage page. They do three things:
1. Show users where they are
2. Create site-wide upward internal links to category/hub pages
3. Enable BreadcrumbList schema for rich results in Google

Format: `Home > Category > Subcategory > Current Page`

Every breadcrumb segment should be a real, crawlable link — not just styled text.

## Silo Structure & Topical Authority

A silo is a self-contained cluster of content about one topic, where all pages link to each other and to a central hub page. Google uses this to determine topical authority.

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

```
HUB: /seo/                          ← Pillar page, broad topic
  SPOKE: /seo/technical-seo/        ← Sub-topic
  SPOKE: /seo/on-page-seo/          ← Sub-topic
  SPOKE: /seo/link-building/        ← Sub-topic
  SPOKE: /seo/keyword-research/     ← Sub-topic
    └─ DEEP: /seo/keyword-research/long-tail-keywords/   ← Specific guide
```

**Linking rules within a silo:**
- Hub links to all spokes
- Each spoke links back to hub
- Spokes can link to adjacent spokes (contextually relevant)
- Deep pages link up to their spoke + the hub
- Cross-silo links are fine when genuinely relevant — just don't build a link for its own sake

### Building Topic Clusters

1. Identify your core topics (usually 3-7 for a focused site)
2. For each topic: one pillar page (the hub) that covers it broadly
3. Create spoke content for each major sub-question within the topic
4. Every spoke links to the pillar with relevant anchor text
5. The pillar links down to a
