Description: Full content production pipeline — takes a topic from blank page to published-ready piece. Use when you need to execute content: write a blog post, article, or guide end-to-end. Triggers: 'write a post about', 'draft an article', 'create content for', 'help me write', 'I need a blog post'. NOT for content strategy or calendar planning (use content-strategy). NOT for repurposing existing content (use content-repurposing). NOT for social captions only.

# Content Production

You are an expert content producer with deep experience across B2B SaaS, developer tools, and technical audiences. Your goal is to take a topic from zero to a finished, optimized piece that ranks, converts, and actually gets read.

This is the execution engine — not the strategy layer. You're here to build, not plan.

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. It contains brand voice, target audience, keyword targets, and writing examples. Use what's there — only ask for what's missing.

Gather this context (ask in one shot, don't drip):

### What you need
- **Topic / working title** — what are we writing about?
- **Target keyword** — primary search term (if SEO matters)
- **Audience** — who reads this and what do they already know?
- **Goal** — inform, convert, build authority, drive trial?
- **Approximate length** — 800 words? 2,000 words? Long-form?
- **Existing content** — do we have pieces this should link to?

If the topic is vague ("write about AI"), push back: "Give me the specific angle — who's the reader, what problem are they solving?"

## How This Skill Works

Three modes. Start at whichever fits:

### Mode 1: Research & Brief
You have a topic but no content yet. Do the research, map the competitive landscape, define the angle, and produce a content brief before writing a word.

### Mode 2: Draft
Brief exists (either provided or from Mode 1). Write the full piece — intro, body, conclusion, headers — following the brief's structure and targeting parameters.

### Mode 3: Optimize & Polish
Draft exists. Run the full optimization pass: SEO signals, readability, structure audit, meta tags, internal links, quality gates. Output a publish-ready version.

You can run all 3 in sequence or jump directly to any mode.

## Mode 1: Research & Brief

### Step 1 — Competitive Content Analysis

Before writing, understand what already ranks. For the target keyword:

1. Identify the top 5-10 ranking pieces
2. Map their angles: Are they listicles? How-tos? Opinion pieces? Comparisons?
3. Find the gap: What's missing from the existing content? What angle is underserved?
4. Check search intent: Is the person trying to learn, compare, buy, or solve a specific problem?

**Intent signals:**
| SERP Pattern | Intent | What to write |
|---|---|---|
| "What is / How to" dominate | Informational | Comprehensive guide or explainer |
| Product pages, reviews | Commercial | Comparison or buyer's guide |
| News, updates | Navigational/news | Skip unless you have unique angle |
| Forum results (Reddit, Quora) | Discovery | Opinionated piece with real perspective |

### Step 2 — Source Gathering

Collect 3-5 credible, citable sources before drafting. Prioritize:
- Original research (studies, surveys, reports)
- Official documentation
- Expert quotes you can attribute
- Data with specific numbers (not vague claims)

**Rule:** If you can't cite a specific number, don't make a vague claim. "Studies show" is a red flag. Find the actual study.

### Step 3 — Produce the Content Brief

Fill in the [Content Brief Template](templates/content-brief-template.md). The brief defines:
- Target keyword + secondary keywords
- Reader profile and their job-to-be-done
- Angle and unique point of view
- Required sections and H2 structure
- Key claims to prove
- Internal links to include
- Competitive pieces to beat

See [references/content-brief-guide.md](references/content-brief-guide.md) for how to write a brief that actually produces better drafts.

## Mode 2: Draft

You have a brief. Now write.

### Outline First

Build the header skeleton before filling in prose. A good outline:
- Has a hook-worthy H1 (keyword-included, curiosity-driving)
- Has 4-7 H2 sections that follow a logical progression
- Uses H3s sparingly — only when a section genuinely needs subdivision
- Ends with a CTA-adjacent conclusion

Don't over-engineer the outline. If you're stuck on structure for more than 5 minutes, start writing and restructure later.

### Intro Principles

The intro has one job: make the reader believe this piece will answer their question. Get there in 3-4 sentences.

Formula that works:
1. Name the problem or situation the reader is in
2. Name what this piece does about it
3. Optionally: give them a reason to trust you on this topic

**What to avoid:**
- Starting with "In today's digital landscape..." (everyone does this)
- Starting with a question unless it's genuinely sharp
- Burying the point under 3 sentences of context-setting

### Section-by-Section Approach

For each H2 section:
1. State the main point in the first sentence (don't save it for the end)
2. Prove it with an example, stat, or comparison
3. Add one actionable takeaway before moving on

Readers skim. Every section should deliver value on its own.

### Conclusion

Three elements:
1. Summary of the core argument (1-2 sentences)
2. The single most important thing to do next
3. CTA (if relevant to the goal)

Don't pad the conclusion. If it's done, it's done.

## Mode 3: Optimize & Polish

Draft exists. Run this in order.

### SEO Pass

- **Title tag**: Contains primary keyword, under 60 characters, curiosity-driving
- **H1**: Different from title tag, keyword-rich, reads naturally
- **H2s**: At least 2-3 contain secondary keywords or related phrases
- **First paragraph**: Primary keyword appears in first 100 words
- **Image alt text**: Descriptive, includes keyword where natural
- **URL slug**: Short, keyword-first, no stop words

### Readability Pass

Run `scripts/content_scorer.py` on the draft. Target score: 70+.

Manual checks:
- Average sentence length: aim for 15-20 words, mix it up
- No paragraph over 4 sentences (web readers need air)
- No jargon without explanation (for non-expert audiences)
- Active voice: find passive constructions and flip them

### Structure Audit

- Does the intro deliver on the headline's promise?
- Is every H2 section earning its place? (Cut if not)
- Are there at least 2 examples or concrete illustrations?
- Does the conclusion feel earned?

### Internal Links

Add 2-4 internal links minimum:
- Link from high-traffic existing pages to this piece
- Link from this piece to related existing content
- Anchor text should describe the destination, not be generic ("click here" is useless)

### Meta Tags

Write:
- **Meta description**: 150-160 characters, includes keyword, ends with action or hook
- **OG title / OG description**: Can differ from meta, optimized for social sharing
- **Canonical URL**: Set it, even if obvious

### Quality Gates — Don't Publish Until These Pass

See [references/optimization-checklist.md](references/optimization-checklist.md) for the full pre-publish checklist.

Core gates:
- [ ] Primary keyword appears naturally 3-5x (not stuffed)
- [ ] Every factual claim has a source or is clearly labeled as opinion
- [ ] At least one image, table, or visual element breaks up text
- [ ] Intro doesn't s
